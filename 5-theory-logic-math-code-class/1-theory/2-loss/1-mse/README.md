## How to Use

If you have following results from a model:

![Results](media/results.png)

You can just take difference of all

![Diff](media/difference.png)

then take square of differences

![Square of Diff](media/square-of-diff.png)

now just add these squared differences

![Squared Diff Sum](media/sd-sum.png)

And divide it by number of samples

![MSE Result](media/mse-result.png)

This is mean squared error result

## Take a look at ormula

Now if you take a look at formula again

![MSE Formula](media/mse.png)

You will understand how does this sigmoid works
