## Steps to Follow
for an AI-Student

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Read the dataset.
   - Normalize or scale the features if required.
   - Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
   - Perform feature engineering to create new features or modify existing ones.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a machine learning model based on the problem (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, neural network).

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the selected model using the training set.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using the validation set.
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or others depending on the problem.

6. **Model Testing**:
   - Test the final model using the testing set to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

7. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model to a production environment for inference.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Monitor the model's performance in production.
   - Retrain or update the model as needed to maintain performance.
